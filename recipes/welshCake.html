    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A Welsh teatime treat passed on through generations and still as popular as ever!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>225g plain flour</li>
        <li>85g caster sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp mixed spice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>50g butter (in small pieces)</li>
        <li>50g lard (in small pieces)</li>
        <li>50g currant</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>splash of milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put flour, sugar, mixed spice, baking powder, and a pinch of salt into a bowl. Then, with fingers, rub in the butter and lard until crumbly. Mix in the currants. Work the egg into the mixture until you have a soft dough, adding a splash of milk if it seems dry.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough onto a lightly floured work surface to the thickness of your little finger. Then, cut out round pieces using a 6cm cutter, re-roll the trimmings.</li>
        <li>Great a flat griddle pan or heavy frying pan with the lard and place over medium heat. Cook welsh cakes in batches for 3 minutes each side. They should be golden brown, crisp, and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Now serve! Enjoy warm with butter and jam or with a sprinkle of sugar. Cakes stay fresh in a tin for up to a week.</li>
